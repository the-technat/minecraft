# Fly Minecraft Servers

A repo containing all things Minecraft.

I'm not a gamer, but as a system engineer I help my friends by setting up their servers so that they don't have to.

## Minecraft Servers

All deployed to a fly.io organization, the folders all contain a `fly.toml` to deploy.

Deployment's are done manually at the time, no Github Action.

## Telegram Minecraft Manager

The [tmm](./tmm) folder contains a draft of a Telegram bot to manage these Minecraft servers. But it's by far not done.
