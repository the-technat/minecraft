# Minecraft Servers

A repo containing all things Minecraft.

I'm not a gamer, but as a system engineer I help my friends by setting up their servers so that they don't have to.

This repo contains a docker-compose file that's deployed somewhere on a random server.

I don't care how udp port 25565 is exposed and how the domain names are linked. Just make sure it somehow works.

The docker volumes are also not backed up from the host automatically.
